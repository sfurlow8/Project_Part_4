# Project_Part_4

We completed a portion of the extra credit project module.

## Setup
Download the files project_bonus.py, copy_files.sh, login.sh, pip_install.sh, and requirements.txt into a folder on your local computer. In order to later log into our EC2 instance, it must be the same folder where the .pem key is located.
